WHAT I DID
*************

For this weeks lab I implemented having the schedule for that week of games to show up. When the user selects a week to look at either that weeks ranking/projections, the schedule for that week shows up underneath the nav bar. The schedule shows the names of the teams that are playing against each other as well as their team logos and the day and time the game was being played at.
