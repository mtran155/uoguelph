Readme for Assignment 2 (Hangman Game)

Notes on the program
---------------------

- When you start the game it will ask you if you want to provide a file or not. If you chose not to provide a file
I have set the game to load up a default file. The default file contains the words found in the legacy code dictionary.
Than it will ask you what the max length of a word can be. If you use your own file and you wanted the max word length to be 
2 and the file only has words with max length of 3 or greater, program will raise an exception and exit. So make sure the text
file has all length of words and you should encounter no problems. The dictionary a2dict.txt that Mr. Wirth gave to us works fine. 

- When the game is generating a new word, it might look like it's sitting there doing nothing. Give it time and it will select 
a new random word for you to play.
