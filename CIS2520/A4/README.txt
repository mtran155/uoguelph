*****************************
How  to compile the program
*****************************

To compile the binary heap implementation use the following command from the root directory
type 'cd Heap' to go into the heap implementation folder from there type 'make' to compile the program

To compile the binary search tree implementation use the following command from the root directory
type 'cd BSTree' to go into the binary search implementation folder from there type 'make' to compile the program

To compile the AVL tree implementation use the following command from the root directory
type 'cd AVLTree' to go into the AVLTree implementation folder from there type 'make' to compile the program


***********************
How to run the program
***********************

To run the myProgram.c from the Heap use the following command
./a.out <N>  where N is an integer to print out the top N students

To run the myProgram.c from the BStree folder use the following command
./a.out

To run the myProgram.c from the AVLTree folder use the following command
./a.out

While executing myProgram.c feedback is given to the user


******************
Known limitations
******************

AVLTree -> Missing John when printing out the tree and because of that it prints out Dave twice
