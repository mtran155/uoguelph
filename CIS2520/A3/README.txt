*****************************
How  to compile the program
*****************************

To compile the linked implementation of a list use the following command from the root directory
type 'cd List_Student_L' to go into the linked implementation of a list folder from there type 
'make' to compile the program

To compile the run time of sorting algorithms use the following command from the root directory
type 'cd List_Int_S' to go into the sorting folder from there type 'make' to compile the programs

To compile the Queue implementation of a queue use the following command from the root directory
type 'cd Queue_Student_S' to go into the queue implementation of a queue folder from there type 
'make' to compile the program


***********************
How to run the program
***********************

To run the myProgram.c from the List_Student_L use the following command
./a.out

To run the test.c, from List_Int_S use the following command
./test.out

While executing test.c feedback is given to the user

To run the sort.c, from List_Int_S use the following command
./sort.out <number_m_of_lists> <size_n_of_lists>

While executing sort.c feedback is given to the user

To run the myProgram.c, from the Queue_Student_S use the following command
./a.out

While executing myProgram.c feedback is given to the user


******************
Known limitations
******************

While sorting lists, the maximum number of integers my program can handle is 100,000 elements in each list
